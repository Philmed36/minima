<h1> My Profile </h1>


<p> Hi, I am Phil Medlin, a student at RMIT. 
My student id: s3779497; email: s3779497@student.rmit.edu.au . I have been caring for my sister who has PTSD. In order to be better prepared for such a task, I have been completing a Bachelor of Psychological Science. As part of my research, I am studying at RMIT to have a better understanding of Information Technology security. Such security is essential if I am to protect my sister effectively.
